                    <p>Chandigarh: When it rains, they say, it pours. The adage certainly held true for Chandigarh today which witnessed its first major shower this monsoon -- the heaviest in the last ten years. The joint capital of Punjab and Haryana received 120.8 mm of rain that caused water-logging at roundabouts and roads, and choked traffic on several routes till late afternoon.This was the first major shower in the city since the southwest monsoon hit the region over a fortnight back.The Union Territory had so far witnessed only scanty rains with sultry weather prevailing."Prior to today's heavy downpour, Chandigarh had received 142 mm of rain on July 26, 2006. On July 5, 2005, the city had got 127.8 mm of rain while the all-time single day heaviest rain record for Chandigarh stands at 262 mm on July 18, 2000," a Met Department official told PTI.After the rains, Chandigarh witnessed a sharp fall in the maximum temperature, which settled at 29.5 degrees Celsius, down four notches against normal, a Met report said.Rains also lashed neighbouring towns including Mohali, Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, and Panchkula and Ambala in Haryana, the Met official said.</p>

                    <p>New Delhi: Monsoon rains are expected to lash Delhi within two days, it was announced on Wednesday.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that this followed a mixed character of monsoon and western disturbance-induced rains in the national capital on Wednesday.The IMD said while most parts of the country, including central India, south Rajashtan and parts of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar were now under monsoon cover, eastern Uttar Pradesh, western Bihar and the National Capital Region still awaited the onset of monsoon."Most likely monsoon will be declared in Delhi by tomorrow," an IMD official told IANS. "Based on data, monsoon will be declared tomorrow (Thursday) or a day later (Friday)."The official said monsoon was being delayed in eastern Uttar Pradesh, one of the most dry areas now, due to a cyclonic circulation over north Odisha, which was cutting the easterly winds and moisture towards Uttar Pradesh."Monsoon will cover all the remaining parts of the country within 24-48 hours. The cyclonic circulation over north Odisha was cutting the moisture till yesterday. Today there was a drop in its activity," the IMD said.
